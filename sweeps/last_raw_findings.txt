I'll search for the latest transfer news on Mouhamed Diop. Let me run several searches to get comprehensive coverage.
I notice there's a confusion here - the search results are showing a different Mouhamed Diop (born 2000, plays for Troyes in France) rather than the 2009-born player at AJEL Rufisque we're looking for. Let me search more specifically.
Now I'm getting better results about the correct player. Let me search for more recent news in French.

## Mouhamed Diop (AJEL Rufisque)

**Summary of Findings:**

The search results largely confirm existing rumors with minimal new information. Key findings include:

**[Feb 13, 2026] Multiple Turkish & African sources** - 
Fenerbahçe close to finalizing arrivals of Mouhamed Diop (AJEL Rufisque) and Victor Étienne Mendy (AS Bambey)
. 
Fenerbahçe in very advanced discussions with current top scorer of AJEL Rufisque
. The Turkish source Sabah and Daily Sports confirm 
Fenerbahçe's negotiations for Mouhamed Diop transfer are at final stages
.

**[Feb 14, 2026] Daily Sports** - 
AJEL Rufisque management expecting no less than €200,000 for possible transfer of Mouhamed Diop, who is currently impressing in Senegalese Ligue 1
.

**New Intel found:** 
- Multiple sources now confirm the deal is in "final stages" rather than just "advanced talks"
- A Dec 14, 2025 match result shows Mouhamed Diop scored twice (8' and 59') in AJEL's 2-1 win vs US Ouakam, demonstrating his continued form

**Note:** There was some confusion in search results with an older Mouhamed Diop (born 2000) at Troyes, but I correctly identified our target player as the 2009-born forward at AJEL Rufisque based on context clues.

**Verdict:** Minor new intel found - progression from "advanced talks" to "final stages" with multiple confirmatory sources.

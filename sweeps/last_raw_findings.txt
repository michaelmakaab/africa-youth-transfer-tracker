=== Batch 1 findings ===
I'll search for transfer news on each of these players. Let me start with comprehensive searches across all seven.
The search for Toure Alassane returned results for different players (older players). Let me search more specifically for the Ivory Coast youth player.
Based on my searches, I've identified a critical issue: **Souleymane Faye (born 2003) is NOT the player listed in your database.** The player you listed is born 2010 and plays for Sahel F.C in Senegal. The search results return a different Souleymane Faye (born 2003, now at Sporting CP). Let me provide comprehensive findings for all seven players:

---

### **Player #3: Toure Alassane (Ivory Coast, FW, b.2009)**
**Status:** Identity unclear — no specific transfer intel found.

**Findings:** Web searches returned results for older/different players named Alassane Touré (French CB, b.1989) and other players. Could not locate specific youth forward Toure Alassane from RC Abidjan U19 (born 2009). No transfer rumors identified.

**Note:** Requires more specific search parameters or alternative name spelling.

---

### **Player #4: Yao Hubert (Ivory Coast, FW/LW, b.2009)**
**Status:** Identity confirmed (born Nov 5, 2009, San Pedro FC).

**Findings:** No new intel found since existing Jan 15, 2026 rumor about FC Nordsjælland. Database profiles confirm player exists at San Pedro U17, matches criteria (1.90m height, 2009 birth year). No February 2026 updates on Nordsjælland deal located.

### **Player #5: Asharaf Loukmane Tapsoba (Burkina Faso, ST, b.2010)**
**Status:** Hammarby interest remains active (no recent deal finalized).

**Findings:** 
The young Burkinabè prodigy is on the radar of Hammarby, with representatives from the Swedish club in Ouagadougou to finalize a deal with the young player's camp
 (reported July 9, 2025). Most recent concrete update is from April 2025. 
Tapsoba was revealed during the 2025 U17 Africa Cup of Nations held in Morocco
. No February 2026 deal finalization reported.

### **Player #6: Souleymane Faye (Senegal, pos unknown, b.2010)**
**CRITICAL ISSUE — IDENTITY MISMATCH DETECTED**

The Souleymane Faye in your database (b.2010, Sahel F.C) could NOT be located. Web searches consistently returned **Souleymane Faye born Feb 8, 2003** who plays for Sporting CP — a different player entirely. 

**For the 2003-born Faye:** 
On January 21, 2026, Faye moved to Portugal, joining Primeira Liga club Sporting CP on a four-and-a-half-year contract for a fee reported to be around €6.5 million
 (transferred from Granada CF).

**Recommendation:** Verify the 2010-born Faye's correct club/position. The 2003-born player is a professional, not a youth prospect.

---

### **Player #7: Cheick Malo (Ivory Coast, MF, b.2009)**
**Status:** Identity confirmed but no transfer activity.

**Findings:** 
Cheick Ahmed Tijane Malo, born July 26, 2009, plays for FC San Pedro U17 as a Central Midfielder
. No transfer rumors or interest reported. Player appears in U17 AFCON 2025 records (2 appearances). No February 2026 transfer intel located.

### **Player #10: Mor Talla Ndiaye (Senegal, CB, b.2008, Liverpool U21s)**
**RECENT UPDATE – Medical Issue Improving, Back on Grass Training**


It has not been ideal at the start of life on Merseyside for Ndiaye, but he is now back on grass preparing to kickstart his career, with a minor issue found in his medical that caused him to be shut down for the first few weeks
. 
"Mor is on the grass," said U21s coach Rob Page, explaining they had to shut him down initially because of something flagged in his medical, but nothing too significant to worry about, just something to manage

### **Player #11: El Hadj Yamar Ndiaye (Senegal, FW, b.2009, Challenge F.C)**
**No new intel found**  
No transfer activity or interest detected. Minimal online presence. Listed as player at Challenge F.C in Senegal with no rumored moves.

---

### **Player #12: Ettienne Mendy (Senegal, FW/RW, b.2008, Diambars FC)**
**UPDATE – Galatasaray Actively Pursuing Post-Man Utd Trial**


The young attacking midfielder Étienne Mendy (known as "Ndo") from Diambars Academy is on Galatasaray's radar; while the football world awaits the outcome of his trial with Manchester United, Galatasaray is actively positioning itself in the race to secure his signature and making moves to lure the young prodigy away from his current home at Diambars Academy in Saly
.


Galatasaray's scouts have been meticulously tracking Mendy's development for some time; his credentials include representing Senegal at the U17 World Cup in Qatar
.

**Note:** The player profile lists Mendy as born 2008 (Transfermarkt shows Jul 25, 2008, age 17). Your database lists him as FW/RW (winger), but sources confirm he is an attacking midfielder, not primarily a winger – this may be a position discrepancy to verify.

=== Batch 3 findings ===
I'll search for transfer news on each of these players. Let me start with comprehensive searches for all six players.
Now let me search for the remaining three players: Ilídio Panda, Ysso Donatien Bama, Pape Sémou Sané, and Mouhamed Diop.
Based on my searches, here's what I found for each player:

## TRANSFER RESEARCH FINDINGS

**Player #18: Ilídio Panda (Angola, FW, born 2008)**

**NEW INTEL - Publication: Feb 13, 2026**

FC Porto is pulling out all the stops to secure the services of Angolan prodigy Ilídio Panda, and the Portuguese giants have made him their top target with his release clause not exceeding €300,000.

This corroborates existing rumors (from Feb 13 in your database) but adds detail about Porto's intensity and the exact release clause amount.

**Player #19: Ysso Donatien Bama (Burkina Faso, CB, born 2007)**

Fenerbahçe is preparing to finalize the arrivals of Mouhamed Diop (AJEL Rufisque) and Victor Étienne Mendy (AS Bambey).

- URL: https://africafoot.com/deux-cracks-senegalais-attendus-a-fenerbahce/
- Publication date: ~February 15, 2026 (estimated from "2 weeks ago" on Feb 27)


Fenerbahçe is in very advanced discussions with AJEL Rufisque's top scorer, with the club demanding at least €200,000 for the player.
 This aligns with your existing rumors showing the deal in "very advanced stages" as of Feb 12-16.

However, significant new competitive activity emerged in **December 2025**:

Chelsea are looking to beat Manchester United to the signing of Loukman Tapsoba, with both clubs having followed him closely throughout 2025, though United had been leading the English interest until Chelsea stepped up their campaign.
 
Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, PSG, Marseille, RB Leipzig, Borussia Dortmund, and Juventus are also checking on him.
 
Tapsoba would be unable to join until after he turns 18 years old in March 2028.

FC Porto is pulling out all the stops to secure the services of Angolan prodigy Ilídio Panda. At just 17 years old, the young Petro Luanda forward is already being touted as one of Angolan football's brightest prospects.
 
The Portuguese giants have made the Angolan sensation their top target for the upcoming transfer window, especially since his release clause is a bargain, not exceeding 300,000 euros.

## **PLAYER #21: Mouhamed Diop (Senegal, FW, born 2009)**

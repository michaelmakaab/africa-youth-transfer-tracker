=== Batch 1 findings ===
I'll search for transfer news on each of these players systematically. Let me start with the searches:
Based on my searches, here are the findings for each player:

## **Player #1: Issouf Dabo**
**No new intel found.** The searches confirmed existing QPR rumors from 
December 2025, with QPR launching concrete offensive and competing with Lorient and Bayer Leverkusen
. No fresh developments beyond what was already documented.

## **Player #2: El Hadj Malick Cissé**
**No new intel found.** 
The AC Milan signing was officially confirmed on January 30, 2026
 with 
€750,000 fixed fee plus bonuses up to €2 million total
, exactly as previously documented. No additional transfer activity since joining Milan Futuro.

## **Player #3: Toure Alassane**
**No new intel found.** Searches only returned basic profile information confirming 
he's a 16-year-old attacker at RC Abidjan U19, born November 5, 2009
. No transfer rumors or club interest found.

## **Player #4: Yao Hubert**
**CONFIRMED EXISTING RUMOR:** The FC Nordsjælland interest is progressing. 
January 2026 reports confirm FC Nordsjælland is "on the point of recruiting" the 16-year-old talent from San Pedro
. 
Danish sources report FCN and Right to Dream Academy are close to a deal, with the plan being Hubert joins the academy first then moves to Farum when ready
. This aligns with the January 15 AfricaFoot report but shows progression.

## **Player #5: Asharaf Loukmane Tapsoba**
**No new intel found.** Searches confirmed his profile and previous performances but no new transfer developments beyond existing documented interest from multiple European clubs. 
Born March 30, 2010, currently with Réal du Faso
.

## **Player #6: Souleymane Faye**
**IDENTITY CONFUSION:** All search results return the established Souleymane Faye (born 2003) who plays for Sporting CP. 
This player recently transferred to Sporting CP in January 2026 for €6.5 million
. Found no results for the 2010-born Souleymane Faye from Sahel F.C. mentioned in the brief.

## **Player #7: Cheick Malo**
**No new intel found.** Searches confirm 
he's a 16-year-old central midfielder at San Pedro U17, born July 26, 2009
. No transfer rumors or club interest identified in current searches.

**Summary:** Most searches yielded no new transfer intelligence. The only notable update is confirmation that Yao Hubert's move to FC Nordsjælland appears to be progressing as expected from the January rumors.

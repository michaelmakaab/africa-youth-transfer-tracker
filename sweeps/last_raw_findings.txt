=== Batch 1 findings ===
I'll search for transfer news on each of these players systematically. Let me start with comprehensive searches across all seven players.
Let me continue searching for the remaining players.
Based on my searches, I need to note an important finding: **Souleymane Faye (born Feb 8, 2003)** from your list does **not match** the player I found. The Souleymane Faye in your records is listed as born in 2010 and currently at Sahel F.C in Senegal. The player I found is a 23-year-old winger born in 2003, now playing for Sporting CP. This is a different person entirely.

Let me compile my findings for each player:

---

=== Batch 3 findings ===
I'll search for transfer news on each of these players. Let me start with comprehensive searches for all of them.
Based on my comprehensive search, here are the transfer findings for each player:

---

## **Player #15: Delfim Luwawu** (Angola, DM, Born 2008)
**No new intel found.** Searches revealed player profiles but no transfer rumors or recent market activity beyond recognition as a prospect from AFCON U17 2025.

---

## **Player #16: Prince Hamed Ouedraogo** (Burkina Faso, GK, Born 2009)
**No new intel found.** Confirmed as a 15-year-old goalkeeper at Réal du Faso; featured in U17 Africa Cup of Nations 2025. No transfer activity detected.

---

## **Player #17: Vincent Gomis** (Senegal, GK, Born 2008)
**No new intel found.** Confirmed as a 17-year-old goalkeeper at Génération Foot. Scout reports praise his distribution and penalty-area control from U17 tournaments, but no transfer rumors identified.

---

## **Player #18: Ilídio Panda** (Angola, FW, Born 2008)
**NEW:** 
FC Porto is pulling out all the stops to secure the services of Angolan prodigy Ilídio Panda. At just 17 years old, the young Petro Luanda forward is already being touted as one of Angolan football's brightest prospects. The Portuguese giants have made the Angolan sensation their top target for the upcoming transfer window, especially since his release clause is a bargain, not exceeding 300,000 euros.

## **Player #19: Ysso Donatien Bama** (Burkina Faso, CB, Born 2007)
**No new intel found.** Confirmed as a defender at Rahimo FC. Rahimo won the Burkina Faso championship treble in 2025, but no transfer activity detected for this player.

## **Player #20: Pape Sémou Sané** (Senegal, FW/RW, Born 2007)
**No new intel found.** Confirmed as an 18-year-old right winger at Casa Sports (born Sep 18, 2007). No transfer rumors identified.

---

## **Player #21: Mouhamed Diop** (Senegal, FW, Born 2009)
**NEW UPDATE:** The recent Fenerbahçe reports have a discrepancy—search results show conflicting player data. 
The Turkish club and the two Senegalese clubs where Mouhamed Diop and Victor Étienne Mendy currently play are reportedly close to reaching an agreement for the transfer of the two players. Mouhamed Diop and Victor Étienne Mendy are expected to join the Turkish Süper Lig.


However, your player is born 2009 (age ~16-17), while the older Mouhamed Diop in Fenerbahçe talks (born Sep 30, 2000, age 25) plays for ESTAC Troyes in Ligue 2. The younger Diop at AJEL Rufisque appears to be the one in your database. 
Mouhamed Diop, 17 years old, should finalize his development with Fenerbahçe. The Turkish club is in very advanced discussion with the current top scorer of the surprising team of AJEL Rufisque.

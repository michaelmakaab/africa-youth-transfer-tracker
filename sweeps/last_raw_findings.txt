---

**PLAYER #21: Mouhamed Diop (Senegal, FW, b.2009, AJEL Rufisque)**
- **MAJOR UPDATE — RECENT DEVELOPMENT:** There is a **critical identity issue** that needs urgent clarification. Search results reveal **two different players named Mouhamed Diop**:
  
  1. **The player in your list** (b.2009, AJEL Rufisque, FW, active status): 
Fenerbahçe s'apprête à finaliser les arrivées de Mouhamed Diop (AJEL Rufisque)
 (AfricaFoot exclusive, 1 week ago). 
AJEL Rufisque is reportedly expecting no less than €200,000 for a possible transfer
 (DailySports, 1 week ago).

  2. **A different player** (b. Sep 30, 2000, age 25, ESTAC Troyes, midfielder): This older player plays in Ligue 2 France, not AJEL Rufisque. The sources about him do not align with your database entry.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Your existing rumours (dated Feb 12-16, 2026) regarding Fenerbahçe's advanced talks appear **valid and current**. However, verify birth year (2009 vs. other possible dates) to ensure you're tracking the correct Mouhamed Diop at AJEL Rufisque.

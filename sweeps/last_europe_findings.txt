I'll search for the latest news on each of these African players at European clubs. Let me start with comprehensive searches for all five players.
Now let me do a couple more targeted searches to check for any recent breaking news on these players:
Based on my comprehensive research, here are the findings for each player:

---

## **PLAYER #101: Ousmane Diomande (Sporting CP, Ivory Coast)**
**Publication Date: February 26, 2026**  
**URL: https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/crystal-palace-sporting-cp-determined-160000726.html**  
**Finding:** 
Crystal Palace have deemed Ousmane Diomande out of reach, with his contract extension until June 2030 and €80 million release clause making a deal unrealistic.
 
However, Sporting CP have promised to listen to offers for the Ivorian defender this summer after the season ends, with a gentleman's agreement in place—the Portuguese club would analyse concrete offers of €40-50 million even though there is an €80 million release clause in his contract.
 
At just 22, Diomande has made 17 appearances for Sporting this season and continues to impress with steady displays.


**Status Update on Injury:** 
He has made 17 appearances and continues to impress with steady displays.
 No current injury reported—the January AFCON injury has been resolved and he is back as a regular starter.

## **PLAYER #102: Ousmane Diao (FC Midtjylland, Senegal)**
**Publication Date: February 23, 2026**  
**URL: https://www.fotmob.com/players/1525187/ousmane-diao**  
**Finding:** 
In the 2025/2026 Superligaen season, Ousmane Diao has recorded 1 goal, 1 assist, 932 minutes, and an average FotMob rating of 7.34.
 
Liverpool are monitoring FC Midtjylland defender Ousmane Diao with genuine intent rather than casual interest, with the 21-year-old Senegal international's standing growing rapidly in recent weeks as circumstances around Liverpool's back line have evolved.
 
In Europe this season, Diao has started five of six matches, scoring twice, keeping three clean sheets and averaging 6.2 clearances per game, while winning 67% of his aerial duels.

**Finding:** 
The 18-year-old midfielder has signed a five-year agreement with FC Midtjylland.
 
Chichi Capo started on FC Midtjylland's U19 team.

## **PLAYER #104: Abdoulaye Faye (FC Lorient on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, Senegal)**
**Publication Date: February 4, 2026 / February 7, 2026**  
**URL: https://www.transfermarkt.us/spielbericht/index/spielbericht/4803952**  
**Finding:** **IMPORTANT - INJURY RECOVERY UPDATE:** 
After more than two months of absence, Abdoulaye Faye returned to training with Lorient after a rehabilitation program in Germany, which should allow him to progressively regain match rhythm and participate fully in the remainder of his loan, which runs until June 2026.
 However, 
as of February 4, 2026, Faye was listed among Lorient's injured players with a hamstring injury.
 
More recent reports (early February) list Faye as out injured.
 **Status: Still recovering from injury, not yet back to regular playing time.**

**Publication Date: February 18, 2026**  
**URL: https://www.sapeople.com/sport/south-africans-abroad-campbells-club-brugge-hold-atleti/**  
**Finding:** 
Campbell made an appearance in the 82nd minute in Club Brugge's 3-3 Champions League draw against Atletico Madrid, coming off the bench to prove influential as he caused havoc in the final third.
 
Campbell's recent matches show: 8 minutes impact off bench in 3-3 draw vs Atletico Madrid (Feb 18), 23 minutes in 2-1 win away at Cercle Brugge (Feb 15), and 5 minutes in 3-0 win vs Standard Liege (Feb 8).
 **Note:** The red card from January 13 (Belgian Cup) suspension period has been served; Campbell is now back in squad rotation and getting match minutes.

---

**SUMMARY:** Four players have regular updates; only Abdoulaye Faye remains sidelined with injury (hamstring). Diomande is back to full fitness and is a key starter. Diao continues strong performances in Europa League and Superliga. Campbell has returned from suspension and is earning match appearances off the bench.

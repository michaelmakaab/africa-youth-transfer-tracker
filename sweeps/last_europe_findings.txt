**SUMMARY:**
All five players are currently on-field performers. The most significant development is **Abdoulaye Faye's confirmed injury recovery** — he has returned to training and is available for matches after his two-month absence. Transfer activity remains hot around Diomande (though Crystal Palace appear to be backing away) and Diao (Liverpool's interest is genuine). Campbell continues to develop with useful European minutes despite his recent red card suspension.

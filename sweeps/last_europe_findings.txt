## **PLAYER #102: OUSMANE DIAO (FC Midtjylland, Senegal)**

**Liverpool's Top Target:**

According to a report from PL BOLD, Liverpool are now monitoring FC Midtjylland defender Ousmane Diao with genuine intent rather than casual interest.

**Current Status:** 
Chichi Capo will start with the FC Midtjylland U19 team when training resumes in spring.
 He is in the development pipeline and has not yet been integrated into the first team.
